    You are a Senior Data Analyst. Based on the data in 'analysis_data.json', write a comprehensive insight report.
    
    Key Focus Areas:
    1. Compare the strategic roles of different channels based on 'global_overview' and 'promo_stat'.
    2. For each channel in 'channels', analyze its 'metrics' and 'top_categories' to define its user persona.
    3. Deep dive into the 'cubes' (Drill-down scenarios). Pay attention to:
       - 'associations': What items are bought together?
       - 'clusters': Is the consumption dominated by 'Low Value' or 'High Value' clusters?
       - 'promo_perf': Is the scenario promotion-driven?
